# -One-Step-Fastq2Exp-in-RNA-Seq
One Step Fastq2Exp in RNA-Seq, as the name suggests, refers to the elegant transformation from caterpillar (fastq) to butterfly (expression matrix [fpkm, tpm, counts]) in a single step. Additionally, during this metamorphosis process, it generates BAM files for each sample as well as a merged BAM file.
